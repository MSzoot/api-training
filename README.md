## Dog Pictures Gallery App

https://showmedogs.netlify.app  

Super simple Vanilla JavaScript project I did to learn API's . App fetches data from API and displays a gallery of random dog pictures. The app leverages the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests, handles the JSON response, and dynamically updates the DOM to present a delightful collection of dog images.

### Features
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Uses the Fetch API to retrieve random dog pictures.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Adds images to the webpage in real-time based on API responses.
